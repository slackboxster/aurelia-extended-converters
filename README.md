Aurelia doesn't include simple converters like sort. I wanted to create an easy-to-set-up package that one could just install and work with.
The code in here is not my own, I ripped it off of http://jdanyow.github.io/aurelia-converters-sample/. This package just makes it easy to get this stuff plugged in.
